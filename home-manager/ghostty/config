# A named theme to use. The available themes are currently hardcoded to the

# Contents/Resources/ghostty/themes` directory. On Linux, this list is in the
# `share/ghostty/themes` directory (wherever you installed the Ghostty "share"
# directory.
#
# To see a list of available themes, run `ghostty +list-themes`.
#
# Any additional colors specified via background, foreground, palette, etc.
# will override the colors specified in the theme.
#
# This configuration can be changed at runtime, but the new theme will only
# affect new cells. Existing colored cells will not be updated. Therefore,
# after changing the theme, you should restart any running programs to ensure
# they get the new colors.
#
# A future update will allow custom themes to be installed in certain
# directories.

# Font size in points. This value can be a non-integer and the nearest integer

# then you can get an odd numbered pixel size by specifying a half point.
#
# For example, 13.5pt @ 2px/pt = 27px
#
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals,
# i.e. new windows, tabs, etc. Note that you may still not see the change

#   * `false` - windows won't have native decorations, i.e. titlebar and
#      borders. On MacOS this also disables tabs and tab overview.
#
# The "toggle_window_decoration" keybind action can be used to create

# Window padding. This applies padding between the terminal cells and the

# `y` option is top and bottom. The value is in points, meaning that it will
# be scaled appropriately for screen DPI.
#
# If this value is set too large, the screen will render nothing, because the
# grid will be completely squished by the padding. It is up to you as the user
# to pick a reasonable value. If you pick an unreasonable value, a warning
# will appear in the logs.
#
# Changing these values will only apply after restart.

# A positive value enables blurring of the background when background-opacity
# is less than 1. The value is the blur radius to apply. A value of 20

# The font families to use.
#
# You can generate the list of valid values using the CLI:
#
#     ghostty +list-fonts
#
# This configuration can be repeated multiple times to specify preferred
# fallback fonts when the requested codepoint is not available in the primary
# font. This is particularly useful for multiple languages, symbolic fonts,
# etc.
#
# If you want to overwrite a previous set value rather than append a fallback,
# specify the value as `""` (empty string) to reset the list and then set the
# new values. For example:
#
#     font-family = ""
#     font-family = "My Favorite Font"
#
# Setting any of these as CLI arguments will automatically clear the
# values set in configuration files so you don't need to specify
# `--font-family=""` before setting a new value. You only need to specify
# this within config files if you want to clear previously set values in
# configuration files or on the CLI if you want to clear values set on the
# CLI.
#
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals, i.e.
# new windows, tabs, etc.

# still request an explicit cursor style using escape sequences (such as `CSI
# q`). Shell configurations will often request specific cursor styles.
#
# Note that shell integration will automatically set the cursor to a bar at
# a prompt, regardless of this configuration. You can disable that behavior
# by specifying `shell-integration-features = no-cursor` or disabling shell
# integration entirely.

#   * `block`

# same as a "true" value, as noted below.
#
# If this is not set at all (`null`), then Ghostty will respect DEC Mode 12
# (AT&T cursor blink) as an alternate approach to turning blinking on/off. If
# this is set to any value other than null, DEC mode 12 will be ignored but
# `DECSCUSR` will still be respected.

# you prefix a feature with `no-` then it is disabled. If you omit a feature,
# its default value is used, so you must explicitly disable features you don't
# want. You can also use `true` or `false` to turn all features on or off.

#
#   * `cursor` - Set the cursor to a blinking bar at the prompt.
#
#   * `sudo` - Set sudo wrapper to preserve terminfo.

# The style of the macOS titlebar. Available values are: "native",
# "transparent", and "tabs".
#
# The "native" style uses the native macOS titlebar with zero customization.
# The titlebar will match your window theme (see `window-theme`).
#
# The "transparent" style is the same as "native" but the titlebar will
# be transparent and allow your window background color to come through.
# This makes a more seamless window appearance but looks a little less
# typical for a macOS application and may not work well with all themes.
#
# The "tabs" style is a completely custom titlebar that integrates the
# tab bar into the titlebar. This titlebar always matches the background
# color of the terminal. There are some limitations to this style:
# On macOS 13 and below, saved window state will not restore tabs correctly.
# macOS 14 does not have this issue and any other macOS version has not
# been tested.
#
# The default value is "transparent". This is an opinionated choice
# but its one I think is the most aesthetically pleasing and works in
# most cases.
#
# Changing this option at runtime only applies to new windows.

# keyprotocol=ghostty:kitty`, however a bug in the implementation prevents it
# from working properly. https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/13211 fixes this.
